Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide. This project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. By monitoring the driver's eye movements and facial features through a webcam, the system can detect signs of fatigue such as eye closure and yawning.
